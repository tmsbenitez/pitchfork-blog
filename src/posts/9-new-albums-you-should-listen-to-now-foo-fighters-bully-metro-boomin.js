### Foo Fighters: But Here We Are [Roswell/RCA]

Off the back of a heartbreaking year, Foo Fighters are back with an album that encompasses their many eras, from the nostalgic dream-pop of “Show Me How” (featuring Dave Grohl’s daughter Violet) to the epic rock sprawl of “The Teacher.” In the absence of the late Taylor Hawkins—and before the arrival of Josh Freese—Dave Grohl drummed across the LP, a first since The Color and the Shape.

Bully, aka Alicia Bognanno, announced Lucky for You with “Days Move Slow” and a music video directed by her sometime collaborator Alex Ross Perry. The Nashville grunge-rocker wrote the single about her dearly departed pup Mezzi. Lucky for You is Bognanno’s first Bully LP since Sugaregg, which landed in 2020. Another new song, “Lose You,” features vocals from fellow Nashville artist Soccer Mommy.

Metro Boomin has donned his soundtrack-composer outfit for the new Spider-Man movie, and the superstar producer netted a barrage of A-listers to help him out. Fresh off his star-studded Coachella sets, Metro Boomin roped in Lil Uzi Vert, James Blake, Future, Offset, Swae Lee, and many more for the soundtrack, executive producing the whole project himself.

### Legend Yae: I Cry Alone… [Alamo]

Legend Yae made his name in his native Orangeburg, South Carolina, sing-rapping about well-trodden themes—agony, addiction, the loss of friends and faith—but with a uniquely emotive voice that can snap from a cool croon to a wailed plea. It is “melodic pain rap that needs to be played loud,” as Pitchfork’s Alphonse Pierre wrote in a February rap column.  Yae previewed his second project of the year, I Cry Alone…, with the gorgeously fraught ballad “Traphouse Luv.”

Detroit hard rock band Protomartyr wrote their new album, Formal Growth in the Desert, around the concept of “emotional deserts, or a place or time that seems to lack life,” as vocalist Joe Casey put it in a press release. Casey was coping with the death of his mother as he penned the band’s sixth album, which was recorded at Sonic Ranch in Tornillo, Texas, alongside producer Jake Aron. The quartet announced the new record earlier this year, releasing a Trevor Naud–directed music video for lead single “Make Way.”

Indie mainstay Juan Wauters recorded his latest LP, Wandering Rebel, during stints in New York, Los Angeles, Brazil, and Argentina—lending a literal slant to the title. He even wrote parts of the album on a trip to a remote town in his birth country Uruguay, where he collected his thoughts on a solar panel–charged iPad. Wandering Rebel includes contributions from Frankie Cosmos, Y La Bamba, John Carroll Kirby, Super Willy K, and Zoe Gotusso.

### Anthony Naples: Orbs [ANS]

Anthony Naples explores the starry outer reaches of ambient techno on his fifth album, texturing his trademark dubby grooves with languid keys, loungey detours, and shoegaze swaths of particulate harmony. It is another slow-burner from the New York DJ and Incienso label honcho, continuing his diversion from the physicality of 2019’s Fog FM and his marquee DJ sets.

### Speakers Corner Quartet: Further Out Than the Edge [OTIH]

In 2021, long after their tenure as the house band of a south London open-mic night, Speakers Corner Quartet reunited for a show at the venerable Barbican venue, joined by a who’s who of the English capital’s experimental pop, R&B, and jazz worlds. Sampha, Tirzah, Mica Levi, Shabaka Hutchings, and Kae Tempest were among them, and those artists and more return with the quartet on its debut album, a swirl of jazz and hip-hop uniquely imprinted by each rotating guest.

### The Stools: R U Saved? [Feel It]

The Stools are a punk band from Detroit made up of childhood friends Will Lorenz (vocals/guitar), Charles Stahl (drums), and Krystian Quint (bass/vocals). The trio formed in 2016, recording to tape on an old boombox. After issuing a string of EPs, split records, and singles, the Stools are releasing their first proper full-length, R U Saved? The album fuses grimy blues riffs with high-octane rock’n’roll, clocking in at a brisk 23 minutes.
