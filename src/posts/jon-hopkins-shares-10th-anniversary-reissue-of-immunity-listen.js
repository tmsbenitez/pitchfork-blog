Jon Hopkins has released a fully remastered 10th anniversary edition of his fourth studio album, Immunity. The updated LP will be released on vinyl—including a first-time color pressing—on October 6 via Domino. Until then, you can stream the reissue below.

The commemorative re-release of Immunity will include all-new artwork and liner notes. “Immunity was written between late 2010 and early 2012. I poured everything into it, taking so much care over every element,” Hopkins said in a press release. “This record changed my life. I went from playing 500-cap venues to 5,000-cap in less than a year. The whole thing was a whirlwind and has since given me the freedom to follow any creative route that comes to me. Making and releasing it was a very special experience.”

Hopkins’ most recent album, Music for Psychedelic Therapy, arrived in 2021.
