  A new Dolby Atmos mix of the Beach Boys’ 1966 classic, Pet Sounds, has been released. The Beach Boys asked producer Giles Martin to oversee the mix and gave him access to the original analog tapes, as well as Brian Wilson’s original mono mix. Martin also used Mark Linett’s 1997 stereo mix as a guide. Listen to the newly mixed Pet Sounds below.

  Pet Sounds was released in May of 1966. It exerted an outsize influence on rock and pop, particularly in its use of the recording studio as an instrument. Brian Wilson’s approach was heavily informed by Phil Spector’s trademark “wall of sound,” as well as the Beatles’ 1965 LP Rubber Soul.

  “Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys is a game-changing, iconic album that changed the face of popular music,” Giles Martin said in press materials. “It influenced the Beatles to go and make Sgt. Pepper’s, Sgt. Pepper’s then influenced Pink Floyd to go and make The Dark Side of the Moon. It’s a fascinating record because it’s really the workings of a genius, Brian Wilson, that sort of had boundless enthusiasm for ideas and textures.”

  Martin added that Pet Sounds is “an album of so much color and texture and imagination and the imagination becomes realized much more in the spatial realm.”
