In April, after teasing it at Coachella, Latto released the single “Put It on da Floor.” She’s now recruited Cardi B for the remix, titled “Put It on da Floor Again.” In the accompanying music video, Latto and Cardi shop and engage in some shenanigans in a department store. Cardi B’s husband, Offset, also makes a brief cameo. Check it out below.

“Put It on da Floor” caused a bit of a stir upon release due to a line that Coi Leray initially perceived as a diss: “Smokin’ on that gas, blunt big as Coi Leray.” Latto later said that the lyric was meant lovingly, and Coi Leray mostly accepted the concession.

Latto released 777 last year, and it contributed to her being nominated for Best New Artist and Best Melodic Rap Performance at the 2023 Grammy Awards. “Put It on da Floor” and its remix follow Latto’s February single, “Lottery.”

“Put It on da Floor Again” marks Cardi B’s first guest appearance of 2023. Last year, she appeared on “No Love (Extended),” “Shake It,” “Tomorrow 2,” “Despechá Rmx,” and “The Seaweed Sway,” as well as her own “Hot Shit.”
