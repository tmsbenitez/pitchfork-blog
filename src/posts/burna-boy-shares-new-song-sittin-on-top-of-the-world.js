Burna Boy has shared a new single, a track titled “Sittin’ on Top of the World.” It samples “Top of the World,” Brandy’s Mase-sampling hit from 1998. Check out Burna Boy’s latest below.

The Afro-fusion star last issued an album with 2022’s Love, Damini, after which he contributed “Alone” to the soundtrack album for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Having performed at Coachella, Dreamville, and the NBA All-Star Game earlier this year, Burna Boy will become the first Nigerian artist to headline a stadium in the United States with a gig at New York’s Citi Field in July.
